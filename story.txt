One day, a teacher ran a design workshop for a group of children, guilding them to design something they like. One kid name James drew a glove and the teacher asked him what he was designing. James said he like hamburgers, so he want to have the superpower to turn a hamburger out of a open palm. The teacher asked him is this glove can turn a hamburger out of palm? James said "No, it's me, I can turn into a burger, not the glove". Then the teacher asked him what is the purpose of the glove? James said "when I don't want to eat a burger, I wear these gloves so I don't accidentally turn out a burger."
