One day, a teacher ran a design workshop for a group of children, guilding them to design something they like. One kid name James drew a glove and the teacher asked him what he was designing. James said he like hamburgers, so he want to have the superpower to turn a hamburger out of a open palm. The teacher asked him is this glove can turn a hamburger out of palm? James said "No, it's me, I can turn into a burger, not the glove". Then the teacher asked him what is the purpose of the glove? James said "when I don't want to eat a burger, I wear these gloves so I don't accidentally turn out a burger." We switch into a daydream where James has the superpower he has described. James is praised as a god for single handedly ending world hunger, as he constantly keeps his palms open to generate a number of hamburgers only limited by the energy required to keep his palm open. James knows that he has the ability to end the lives of thousands, but that that ability only lies in the vault he keeps under his bed. That vault contains a pair of white gloves, which will prevent the unlimited food from being generated from his hands. Does James consider that he could live a normal life with those gloves? Of course, but the constant debate that he suffers from is whether he should put them on and live a life free of burden, or provide provide life to thousands of people.
